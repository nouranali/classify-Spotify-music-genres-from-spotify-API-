# classify-Spotify-music-genres-from-Spotify-API-

### This project was done to practice some of the things I recently learned in ML and to practice getting data from an API

### All I did was to get 3 or 4 playlists from spotify and pull their data from the API and then get the data "audio features" for each track and put them in csv files then concat them into one data frame and do ML work

## Used Libraries

 - spotipy
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - scikit-learn
 - plotly
 - matplotlib
 - scipy
 
### Checkout the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nouranali/classify-Spotify-music-genres-from-spotify-API-/blob/master/spotify%20genres.ipynb) to show all plots "plotly isn't rendered on github yet"
### also checkout the .py files for codes interacting with API
